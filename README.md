<summary><h3> Omars Tech Past & Journey </h3></summary>

As a young kid, the day my dad bought me my first lego-robotics kit was the day I knew Mechatronics was my passion. The thing I love about mechatronics is the ability to bring my wildest ideas to life. The joy I attain after successfully completing a tech project is indescribable, leading me to create a summer robotics camp where I teach 50+ STEM passionate students the art of robotics every year. My interest in robotics has driven me to experiment with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and PID Control systems. In my spare time, I try to further deepen my understanding of robotics, leading me to build objects ranging from autonomous cars to PID controllers. The experiences I gained from the multitude of ECâ€™s I have engaged in have shaped who I am today. As well, as the son of a Comp. Sci professor, I have been exposed to a plethora of programming languages, including C#, C++, and Small Basic. With over two years of experience in coding, I have developed a fully playable 2D XBox game I named "The Infected". Moving forward, I hope to enhance my programming knowledge and aim to one day revolutionize the world of technology as we know it!
